We needed strong industry insight across festivals, live events, marketing, and the technologies supporting them.\n\nAndy brought exactly that. With his deep knowledge of the global festivals and events market and his extensive international network, he helped us quickly build credibility and become a trusted partner to festivals and events in over 25 countries. His input went well beyond technology, covering positioning, partnerships, go-to-market strategy, and how to engage the right decision-makers.\n\nI have continued to rely on Andy's perspective over the years, and he is currently acting as an advisor to me and my current venture, Samachi. I would highly recommend speaking with Andy if you are operating in festivals, live entertainment, ticketing, or adjacent sectors and are looking for experienced, commercially minded advisory support."
